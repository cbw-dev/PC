## Lab

[Your lab here]

<!-- These pages should be a rendered and compiled version of your code, if you have code.  -->

<!-- R, python, bash and more can run in bookdown.  -->

```{r}
# Your R code here

# For example:
x <- 42
x
```

```{python}
# Your python code here

# For example:
print("hello world")
```

```{bash}
# Your bash code here

# For example:
#pwd
```

<!-- Note, "pwd" is commented out, since it is a bash command, it may cause an error in building for Windows users. -->

Try running these code "chunks" by pressing the green (left-pointing) triangle next to your code chunks. 

You will see the code run in the console and the output provided below the code chunk.

The output of the code will also be produced under the code chunk on your website page.
